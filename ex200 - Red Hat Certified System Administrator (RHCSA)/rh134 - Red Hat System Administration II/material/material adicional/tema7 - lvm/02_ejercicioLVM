You must do all exersices in serverX machine, after you reset it.

Exercise 1.


1. Use the fdisk or gdisk or parted command to add 3 new partitions to /dev/vdX disk, each about 256, 512 and 2048 megabytes in size, respectively. Set the filesystem labels of each newly created partition to "8e" (Linux LVM). 

2. Use the pvcreate command to initialize each of the newly created partitions as physical volumes. 

3 Use the vgcreate command to create a volume group named vol_group with the last two physical volumes, and a physical extent size of 32 megabytes. Leave the first physical volume unused. 

4. Use the lvcreate command to create a logical volume named logvol1, which is  1024 megabytes in size. 
Do the same for a logical volume named logvol2, also 1024 megabytes in size. 

5. Format the logical volumes logvol1 and logvol2 with ext4 and xfs filesystems, respectively.

6. Create the mount points (directories) /lvm1 and /lvm2. Mount the logical volumes logvol1 and logvol2 to the respective mount points. 

7. Create entries within your /etc/fstab file so that the logical volumes are mounted automatically at bootup. Reboot your machine, and confirm that the mounts are automatically performed. 

8. Bonus Track: Rename de volume group vol_group to groupVol. Rename the logical volume logvol2 to lv2.


Exercise 2. 
 
1. Expand the logical volume and its file system to dynamically grow the mounted filesystem on logical volume lv2 by 21 logical extents.

2. Try to reduce the volume group groupVol by one physical volume, could you do it without lose any logical volume? If not, don't do it.

3. Delete the logical volume logvol1. Now, remove your first physical volume from the volume group vol_group, could you do it without lose any logical volume?

4. Create a snapshot volume of lv2 called snap_lv2 with 50 megabytes.
